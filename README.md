# Parcel Delivery System
### Core Stack
> JavaServer Faces (JSF), `JSF 8` 

### The Application
>   Parcel Delivery System <br/>
    The parcel delivery system, is a Java EE based application built with NetBeans leveraging MVC (Model–view–controller) for parcel delivery and tracking. The presentation layer uses `XHTML`, and the application runs on `SQL` (Structured Query Language) powered by `JDBC` (Java Database Connectivity).

    The application uses three `use cases` (customer, manager, and driver) and five events (book a collection, deliver a parcel, track, and collect a parcel).
    Some design processes are USDP, Rational Unified Process, OpenUp, and Agile Unified. The USDP approach was used in my design 


### USDP Approach/Advantages
> I used the Unified Software Development Process (USDP) for iterative and   incremental workflow due to the following advantages:  <br/>

    1.	It makes the development of JSF applications easy to implement <br/>
    2.	It allows for a smooth transition between different stages of software development. <br/>
    3.	It provides a standard graphical language for expressing and discussing design ideas and requirements, especially in parallel development. <br/>
    4.	It allows professionals to allow us to adjust the quantity and quality of project documentation as required by the project time, volume, budget, and future expansion needs. <br/>
